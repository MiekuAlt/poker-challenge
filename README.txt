* Michael Altair's Submission for the Swept Challenge *

I have chosen to do the Programming Problem #2,
I also thought it make a good little Android App!

The code consists of two Java classes: MainActivity and Hand
- MainActivity handles all of the front-end aspects of the app, as well as comparing the different hands
- Hand handles the calculations and data for the player's specific hand

I have also incorporated two classes for Unit Testing: UnitTests and UnitTestCompare
- UnitTests handles the testing to ensure that the type of hands are figured out correctly (FULLHOUSE, STRAIGHT, ...), there are 26 tests in this class 
- UnitTestCompare handles the testing to ensure that the winners are determined correctly as well as checking how ties are handled, there are 24 tests in this class

Files/Folders provided are:

- SweptPokerChallenge
** This is the Android Studio project file.

- CodePulledFromProject
** Due to it being a pain to find java files in an Android Studio project, I made a copy of all my code and put it in this directory for you.

- AlgorithmFlowChart
** This is a pdf of a simple overview of the algorithms used for the app, I made it for myself but thought you might be interested.

- AppScreenShot
** This is a screenshot of the app doing example #1 in the instructions.

- swept-poker.apk
** This is the signed APK for the app itself. Easy way to download it is to move it into your device's downloads folder and install it from there!


*** Enjoy! It was fun to build! ***
